Self-learning MySQL

In the past few days I learned SQL through online resources like GeeksforGeeks and explored my skills through this project.

It helped me enhance my skill, particularly in data management, problem-solving, and database optimization. 

This is a data cleaning project which was performed on database of layoffs made by several companies around the world.

I performed strategic steps to clean this Raw Data and make into a more usable format, like useful for visualization, for exploratory data analysis and many more cases.

Improved my SQL Query Proficiency and Data Cleaning Techniques such as:

1. Remove Duplicates

2. Standardize the Data

3. Handling NULL and Blank Values

4. Remove unnecessary Column or Row

Looking forward to deep dive in Data science & Analysis field
